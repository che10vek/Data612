##Plan

My plan is to build out a book recommendation system using the Goodreads Dataset. There are close to $6M ratings in the dataset so I might need to focus on the subset of it to keep the analysis doable on a laptop computer. This recommender system will recommend books to users based on their previous ratings. I plan to use SVD as well as IBCF and UBCF and compare their performance for this dataset. As with all book ratings datasets - this dataset is pretty sparse, there are 10K books and 53K users rating so 6M our of 530M potential ratings is about 99% sparse. 

The data can be found here:
